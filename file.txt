Early Ideas (1940s-1950s):

Alan Turing proposed machines could simulate human intelligence.
Mathematical theories laid the foundation for algorithms.
Symbolic AI (1950s-1970s):

Focused on rule-based reasoning and simple AI programs like ELIZA.
Machine Learning (1980s-1990s):

Shifted to training machines to learn from data.
Neural networks, inspired by the brain, were developed.
Big Data & Hardware (2000s):

Explosion of data and powerful GPUs enabled more advanced models.
Modern AI (2010s-Present):

Deep learning models excel in tasks like image and speech recognition.
AI is now widely used in healthcare, finance, and more.
Ethics & Responsibility:

Focus on transparency, fairness, and accountability in AI systems.
